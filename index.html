        <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>

        <p>
            Even if my profile pic is a red panda, I assure I'm definitively a human!
        </p>
        <p>
            As a curious person, and a science fan, I deal a lot with computers and stuff around them. I started programming at 8 years old, and never stopped since. </p>
        <p>   
            I do a lot of things with code. Games, Websites, sometimes GUI Apps, Linux-related programs, and even more. <br>
            I also work as a "freelance" web dev who likes above all to make beautiful and fluent - but static - websites for your business or anything else.

                <h3 class="project-title">Nao's Universe: Endless Run</h3>
                <p class="project-desc">N.U.E.R wasn't the first game I made, but it was the first that really got published, over GitHub and, for a time, itch.io. It was really hard work, and took me almost one year (with big breaks) to complete.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/khyrthy/SAM" class="project" target="_blank">
